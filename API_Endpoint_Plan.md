# RaceDay System — API Endpoint Plan

This table lists every endpoint the RaceDay REST API will expose, planned before any API code is written (Part 2). It is based on the data model in `RaceDay_ERD.png` (Roles, Users, Events, Categories, Enrolments, Results).

**Roles used in this plan:** `None` = public/unauthenticated, `Any (logged in)` = any authenticated user, `Participant`, `Organiser` (usually scoped to the resource's owner), `Admin`.
